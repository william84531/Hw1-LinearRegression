## Introduction

Welcome to the **Linear Regression Analysis with Streamlit** project! This application provides an interactive platform to visualize and understand the fundamentals of linear regression. By adjusting parameters such as slope, noise scale, and the number of data points, users can observe how these factors influence the performance and accuracy of a linear regression model.

Streamlit is leveraged to create a user-friendly web interface, enabling real-time updates and visualizations without the need for extensive coding knowledge. Whether you're a student, educator, data scientist, or data enthusiast, this tool offers a hands-on experience to grasp the concepts of linear regression effectively.

## Features

- **Interactive Parameter Adjustment**: Modify slope, noise scale, and the number of data points using intuitive sliders and input fields.
- **Real-Time Model Training and Prediction**: Instantly see how changes in parameters affect the linear regression model's performance.
- **Performance Metrics**: View key metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) to evaluate model accuracy.
- **Data Visualization**: Generate scatter plots comparing actual values versus predicted values to visualize model fit.
- **Data Sample Display**: Optionally display a sample of the generated dataset for better understanding.
- **Responsive Design**: The application updates in real-time as parameters are adjusted, providing immediate feedback.
